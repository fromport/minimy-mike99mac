All skills ultimately inherit from the SimpleVoiceAssistant base class sva_base.py.

Media skills like those that front music services (Spotify, YouTube, etc) should 
inherit from  MediaSkill (see file sva_media_skill_base.py). They will be required
to provide two entry points used by the system. One returns the confidence the skill
can handle the request given the input, while the second entry point actually plays
the media using the media_player skill. See skill_media_player for more information
on how to use the system media player skill. 

Question and Answer skills like wikipedia should inherit from QuestionAnswerSkill.
Much like Media skills, Q&A skills provide two entry points. One for confidence 
and one for action. Question and Answer skills typically use the self.speak() method
to speak their results in their action handlers.

All other skills are considered user skills and should inherit from SimpleVoiceAssistant
directly like the example skill. See user_skills/example1/__init__.py for more information.


Technical Details
-----------------
The fallback skill handles any unrecognized utterances and sends messages to all registered
Q&A skills to ask their confidence they can cover the question. If they are selected then
their play entry point will be called. Note this only happens if the system could not match
the spoken user input with an intent.

A similar approach is taken by the media skill (skill_media.py). The media skill base class
initially handles all media requests. It may send the command on to a media skill, but 
typically it will catch the media oriented verbs first (like pause, resume, etc) and then
forward them on to the appropriate skill based on system state.

The system skill handles special cases like single word utterances that are recognized as
either system level commands or media commands (like play, pause, resume, etc). It also
handles focus requests and in general manages the overall state of the system. 

The volume skill is linux specific and will need to be changed for other operating systems.
Mainly just the actual command line command to change the volume is all that needs to change.
See the hal/ subdirectory for more information.
