This skill demonstrates how one might work with the Home Assistant home automation system.
It relies on user configuration to expose switch devices by creating 'friendly names' for
each supported device. In this context, a friendly name is an alias for how a user might
want to refer to a device and a device is specifically a light (not a TV) controlled by a
simple on/off switch. One or more aliases may refer to the same physical device. Most 
devices friendly name is the same as the device name but some (those with non unique IDs)
must be set manually in the configuration.yaml file.

As for physical device, a switch is an ambiguous concept since users typically refer to 
the thing controlled by the switch rather than the actual switch itself. For example, 
you might say 'turn on the living room light' but you would rarely say 'turn on switch
SONOFFSMARTV1x' though you might say something like 'turn off the switch that controls 
the living room light', so when we refer to a switch we really mean what is attached to 
the switch which for the purposes of this example skill specifically refers to lights 
controlled by on/off switches and sensors. 

We could of course also create a skill which just handles generic on/off switches but 
this example assumes we have several different lights all attached to different on/off
switches.

Note this is not a light skill as a light skill for Home Assistant would handle such
additional attributes as color and/or brightness.

This example relies only on the Home Assistant REST API and its inherent structure as 
surfaced through that integration point. It assumes the user has one or more switches
and/or sensors already set up in home assistant. 

if you had a switch named 'living room light' you could say things like ...

turn the living room light on
what is the light in the living room set to
turn off the light in the lving room
set living room light off
turn off the living room light.
etc.

If you had a sensor named 'garage temperature' and a second called
'garage humidity' you could say things like ...

what is the temperature in the garage.
what is the garage humidity.
is the garage temperature over 90 degrees.
 
and so on.
