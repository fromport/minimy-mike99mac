Generic audio channel command is ...

amixer sset channel_name percent

so for example, 

amixer sset Playback 20%

BUT, the sset name is different per os.
For example, 

My Laptop = Speaker and Mic
Mark2 = Playback and Record

this is basically the mapping we are dealing with, however,
The Mark2 also has a hardware volume control. This is different
and is handled differently.

This directory contains minimal ability to handle different 
hardware environments regarding the output device.

The system input device is controlled by replacing the mic.py file. 
The output device is configured by altering the contents of the 
hal.cfg file. The default hal.cfg file is shown below ...

{
    "l":{
        "initialize":"python ../../hal/executables/initialize_linux.py",
        "set_volume":"amixer sset Speaker %s%%",
        "get_volume":"python ../../hal/executables/get_linux_volume.py",
        "set_mic":"amixer sset Mic %s%%",
        "get_mic":"python ../../hal/executables/get_linux_mic_level.py"
        },

    "m":{
        "initialize":"python ../../hal/executables/initialize_mark2.py",
        "set_volume":"amixer sset Playback %s%%",
        "get_volume":"python ../../hal/executables/get_mark2_volume.py",
        "set_mic":"amixer sset Record %s%%",
        "get_mic":"python ../../hal/executables/get_mark2_mic.py"
        }
}

The above configuration supports two basic environments or platforms. 
One is standard linux, indicated by the key 'l'. The second is 'm' 
which is the Mycroft MarkII. 

For the output device the system needs to know how to set the volume 
and optionally, how to get the volume. If standard linux commands can 
not be used then the user should supply commands which can accomplish 
this in the hal/executables subdirectory and reference them in the 
hal.cfg file as shown above. 

For example, if you wanted to create a new configuration for the 
K210 Kendryte development board, you could create a python script which 
could be called from the command line which could alter the volume. This 
script would be located in the hal/executables directory and the command 
to execute it would be entered in the hal.cfg file as a 'get_volume' entry 
for the new custom environment (for example, you could use the key 'k210') 
in the hal.cfg file.

The ultimate goal of this process will be that the system will use the 
hal.cfg file to determine which system command line utility to call to 
set the system volume and/or the mic level.
