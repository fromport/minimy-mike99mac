Skill Developer API

The 'example1' skill located in the user_skills/ directory is a good example
to see how a basic skill can communicate with the user. The time and date
skill is an example of a minimalistic user skill.

All skills that inherit from SimpleVoiceAssistant have these methods available ...

    speak(text, wait=callback)
    play_media(file_uri, delete_on_complete='false')
    converse(timeout)
    get_user_input()
    get_confirmation()
    send_message(message)
    register_intent(intent_type, verb, subject, callback)

additionally, if a skill wishes to see all messages destined for it, it may
add the 'msg_handler' parameter in its super init call. See the help skill
for an example of this.


Q&A Skills additionally have to implement ...

    def get_qna_confidence(msg):
    def qna_answer_question(msg):


And skills which inherit from the Media skill have to implement these methods ...

    def get_media_confidence(msg):
    def media_play(msg):


The inflect module provides speakable numbers. It does things like converting

    Thursday April 27 
to 
    Thursday April twenty seventh

Which some may find helpful. 

The Lingua Franca module provides advanced sentence parsing for things like
extracting dates and times from spoken words. For example 

    '7 pm the day after tomorrow'

would return a datetime object. This can also be helpful when processing 
spoken input.
