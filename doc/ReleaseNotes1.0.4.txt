Release Notes for MiniMy 1.0.4

Overview
--------
First release that gets down to a gnat's ass on how a voice 
assistant framework should behave. Beyond the normal system
skill based logic, there is also the following edge cases 
that were addressed ....

A) What does it mean to be paused (for a skill)
B) What if I am paused playing media and I am asked
to play media? Answer stop paused media and go active playing
new media. Same goes for TTS. If a wiki answer is paused and
you ask wiki another question, the old tts session will be
cancelled and the new one will take over. Note this is not so
for an active wiki answer - in that case the tts sessions are
stacked so you can interrupt yourself. The typical use case
for this would be 

play down on main street
wiki who is Bob Seeger
wiki who was in the silver bullet band

and it would answer the silver bullet band 
when done (or stopped) it would resume with
the answer who is bob seeger and finally should
return to playing the song. 


Code Changes
------------
1) Cleaned up documentation

2) Cleaned up example 1 skill

3) Added support for streams to media player

4) Added RadioFreeMycroft music type skill

5) Changed start file to not start youtube skill for now
Note if both were going to coexist the confidence level
will need to be fixed as both always return 0 or 100

6) Finally fixed pause from user
BUT see tts.py - the very bottom. there is an issue here
and this should not be working this way. you should be 
able to call handle_event not call the handler directly
like it is currently working.
TODO: Fix this !!! 

7) Also, note in the future music skill needs to be 
altered to use the ytdownload to cvlc aproach rather
than the pytube module and then you need to handle
intent clash between the radio and music (media skills)
which should be done by the common play calculate 
confidence base class method.
