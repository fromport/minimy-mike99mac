1) Cleaned up documentation

2) Cleaned up example 1 skill

3) Added support for streams to media player

4) Added RadioFreeMycroft music type skill

5) Changed start file to not start youtube skill for now
Note if both were going to coexist the confidence level
will need to be fixed as both always return 0 or 100

6) Finally fixed pause from user
BUT see tts.py - the very bottom. there is an issue here
and this should not be working this way. you should be 
able to call handle_event not call the handler directly
like it is currently working.
TODO: Fix this !!! 

7) Also, note in the future music skill needs to be 
altered to use the ytdownload to cvlc aproach rather
than the pytube module
